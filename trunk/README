STARTING POINT

We don't like the outputs of our MT systems.

QUESTIONS

1) What don't we like?
	- This is hard to answer!
 
2) What sentences are "interesting?"
	- In the context of iterative system refinement, those that changed between 2 systems
	- In the context of a system vs references, it's harder to say.

3) Why are my translations bad?
	- What are the limits of my training data? (OOV on source and target side and on phrase-tables)
	- What better translation could my system have given? (Oracle decoding)
	- Why didn't my system translate this sentence as X? (Forced decoding + error categorization)
	- Where did it all go wrong? (Search path comparison)



OOV Experiments

- A very rough estimate of reachability.
  $MOSES/scripts/analysis/oov.pl

  	Training	    	Test	
  	Toks    	Voc 	Toks	Voc
en	75M     	595k	66k 	9k
cs	66M     	856k	56k 	15k

n-grams Out of Vocabulary	   1	    2	    3	    4
en                       	1.5%	13.9%	47.8%	79.1%
cs                       	2.2%	29.7%	69.2%	90.0%




Reachability with Moses

- Code by Lane Schwartz; in trunk.
  moses –i in.txt –constraint ref.txt –f moses.ini
- Search not quite exhaustive, bounded by:
  - phrase table filtration; this is OK.
  - -ttable-limit; this is OK.
  - -distortion-limit; this is OK.
  - -translation-option-threshold
  - -max-partial-trans-opt (default 10000)
  - -persistent-cache-size (default 10000)
  - -max-trans-opt-per-coverage (default 50!!)

Tested on 2525 sents.



Linguistically Promising Factored Setup

- Two alternative paths:
   form -> form(+lemma+tag)
   form -> lemma+tag -generate-> form
- Fights target-side sparseness.
- Can use a large monolingual corpus for generation.

- Good:
  - OOV of the generation step 1.1%
  - Reachability hopefully 5\% (estimated on 625 sents)
- Bad:
  - BLEU 12.07±0.45 instead of 13.43±0.45
  - Reachability takes 7--22 min/sent instead of 0.3 sec/sent
  - MERT needed 30 iterations instead of 13


MT-OUTPUT COMPARATOR

- simple tool (written in Perl) for visualisation of differences
  - between two MT-systems
  - between two versions of one MT-system

- input:
  - source sentences,
  - reference translations,
  - two MT-outputs we want to compare

- output:
  - HTML file with highlighted matching sequences
  - sentences are sorted according to the difference in number of n-grams  matching the reference
