QUESTIONS

1) What don't we like?
	- This is hard to answer!
 
2) What sentences are "interesting?"
	- In the context of iterative system refinement, those that changed between 2 systems
	- In the context of a system vs references, it's harder to say.

3) Why are my translations bad?
	- What better translation could my system have given? (Oracle decoding)
	- Why didn't my system translate this sentence as X? (Forced decoding + error categorization)
	- Where did it all go wrong? (Search path comparison)
