Loïc : 
My work consisted in making a unificating interface to show several sentence level metrics and alignments in a easy-readable and fashion way.
I provide a prepare_data.pl script which role is to converts raw data to javascript which will later be used in the html file.

prepare_data.pl needs as input a basename (let's call it base). 
2 kinds of data are considered for now : 
 - header : stored in base.header. Contains the column names.
 - data : stored in base.data. Guess what's inside ;)


TODO list : 
 - include Martin/David other people from Charles University's alignment results ont top of this page.
 - include realistics errors from Jon's work.
