The goal is to develop a tool or set of tools to ease error analysis. We will focus on work with Moses and Joshua; however, a modular approach should be taken so that as much as possible can be re-used with other translation systems.

Error detection part should work with both training and test(devel) data, phrase tables, alignment files etc.

Visualization part should provide maximal comfort for examination of errors: concentration of various data sources at one place and their cross-linking. The possibility to generate HTML files looks quite appealing here.

Some tips what to include:
- OOV rate (occurrences/types in training/test data, source/target language)
- named entity recognition and errors around them (if NER tool is available)
- tri-alignment ref-src-sys
- lemmatized evaluation: for what words the system picked correct lemma but wrong word form?
- matching words (system vs. reference translation) after dropping stopwords
- similar word detection (typos, alternate transcription of loanwords)
- phrase table comparison, glosses: have we translated a phrase using unsuitable alternative?
- wrongly omitted words and phrases
- per-sentence BLEU
- word-order (ref vs. sys)
- tree comparison if parsers available

- Search error types
- Quantify importance, sort
- Graphical output
- If an error type is well defined, count its occurrences
- Possibility to click on a word or phrase and get its occurrences with context
-- in phrase table
-- in training data (both sides aligned)
-- in language model training data (if this is target language)
-- in n-best-translations list
-- other translations of this phrase elsewhere in test data
- All searches can be optionally done lemmatized => we will see when we are not getting the target morphology right. Of course, we will need a lemmatizer.

- Visualization:
-- Any text in any language may have:
--- transliteration (if non-Latin alphabet)
--- glosses (even in a third language)
--- be written right-to-left
